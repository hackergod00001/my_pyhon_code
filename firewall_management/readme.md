# Simple Python + Shell script to manage firewall i.e simply block or unblock any specific port in linux

## Description

Using a Linux server with iptables as the firewall software. In this case, you can create a Python script to manage iptables rules. This script will need to be run with administrative privileges (usually as root) since modifying firewall rules requires elevated permissions

## Here's a simple project outline

### Install Required Libraries

You might need to install some libraries if they are not already available. The subprocess library is used here to run shell commands from Python.

```pip install subprocess```

### Download this Python script

save the python script as `firewall_manager.py` in the dir you want

### Run the Script

#### Run the script with administrative privileges (usually as root):

```sudo python firewall_manager.py```

### Interact with the Script

The script will present a menu to add, remove, list, or exit. You can use it to manage your firewall rules.

### Note

This is a very basic example, and real-world firewall management can be much more complex and nuanced. Make sure you understand the implications of blocking or allowing specific ports and traffic on your system, and always exercise caution when working with firewall rules, especially on production systems. Additionally, the specific commands and procedures may vary depending on your Linux distribution and firewall setup.
